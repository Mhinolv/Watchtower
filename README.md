# Watchtower

A local-first macOS app that shows which software on this Mac is out of date or affected by a known vulnerability, and updates it with one click.

Watchtower is scheduled security research and version assessment. It is not continuous endpoint protection and not exhaustive compromise detection.

Status: in development. See `AGENTS.md`.

## Build and test

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Local data

The engine keeps its state in `~/Library/Application Support/Watchtower/watchtower.sqlite3`.
The folder is mode `0700` and every file in it is mode `0600`. Set `WATCHTOWER_DATA_DIR` or pass `--data-dir` to use another folder.
Scan data never goes into this repo.

## Engine CLI

The app runs the engine and reads one JSON object on stdout. Every object has `schema_version`.

| Command | Output |
|---|---|
| `watchtower version` | `{"schema_version", "engine"}` |
| `watchtower state` | `{"schema_version", "refresh", "coverage", "items"}` |
| `watchtower homebrew` | `{"schema_version", "coverage", "items"}` for Homebrew formulae and casks |
| `watchtower macos` | `{"schema_version", "coverage", "items"}` for the macOS version and build |
| `watchtower apps` | `{"schema_version", "coverage", "items"}` for apps in `/Applications` and `~/Applications` |
| `watchtower osv` | `{"schema_version", "coverage", "databases", "projects", "matches"}` for an offline OSV-Scanner lockfile scan |

If a command fails, stdout stays empty. The engine writes `{"schema_version", "error", "detail"}` to stderr and exits 1.
The contract fixtures are in `Tests/WatchtowerCoreTests/Fixtures`. The engine tests and the Swift tests both check them.

## External calls

| Call | Data sent | When |
|---|---|---|
| GET `https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.json` | None. The full public catalog. A cached `If-None-Match` ETag. | Homebrew check, if formulae are installed |
| GET `https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.json` | None. The full public catalog. A cached `If-None-Match` ETag. | Homebrew check, if casks are installed |
| GET `https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/releases/download/v2.7.0/osv-scanner_darwin_<arch>` | None. The pinned release asset. | OSV scan, if the verified scanner is missing |
| GET `https://osv-vulnerabilities.storage.googleapis.com/{npm,PyPI}/all.zip` | The ecosystem name only. A cached `If-None-Match` ETag. | OSV scan, each refresh, for ecosystems with lockfiles |

The Homebrew check also runs one local command: `brew info --json=v2 --installed`, with `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`.
It never runs `brew update`, `brew upgrade` or install scripts.
The engine keeps a small catalog index in `cache/homebrew/` in the data folder. If a fetch fails, the engine uses that index and reports its original age.

The macOS and app check makes no network call. It reads `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist`, each app's `Info.plist`, the Electron framework `Info.plist` and the first 4 KB of each main executable.
It never launches an app. For the cask links, `watchtower apps` also runs the `brew info` command above, once.

The OSV scan runs only OSV-Scanner v2.7.0. `engine/watchtower_engine/scanners/release_pin.py` holds the SHA-256 digests from the official release.
The engine checks the digest after the download and before each run. If the digest does not match, the scanner does not run.
The scanner runs with `--offline` against the local databases in `osv/` in the data folder, so the scan sends nothing.
It scans `package-lock.json` and `uv.lock` only. A database older than 7 days makes the OSV coverage `stale`.
